Welcome to RedditSnoop, a versatile Reddit scraping and viewing tool meticulously crafted by Mr005K. This project is designed to offer programmers and Reddit enthusiasts a streamlined frontend for accessing and exploring Reddit's extensive content.

**Features:**
- Seamless Subreddit Scraping: Utilize RedditSnoop's advanced scraping capabilities to effortlessly retrieve the latest posts from your preferred subreddits. Simply input the subreddit name (excluding the "r/" prefix), and let RedditSnoop handle the rest.

- Robust Sorting Options: Tailor your Reddit experience by sorting posts based on criteria such as "top," "hot," "new," and "controversial." Gain precise control over time-based filters, including "past hour," "24 hours," "past month," "past year," or "all time."


# USAGE
- The plan is to host a mirror of it. Currently, you can simply download the latest release and run index.html
  
# CONTRIBUTE
RedditSnoop is an open-source project, and contributions are warmly welcomed, especially due to my limited programming skills. Feel free to fork the repository, make improvements, and submit pull requests. Let's collaborate to enhance RedditSnoop and make it even more powerful and feature-rich.

# FUTURE PLANS (MAYBE)
- Custom Post Search
- Improving Video And Image Embeds, Adding *PROPER* support for **Redgifs**, **IMGUR** etc.
- Enhanced Search Functionality

# NOT SUPPORTED

Due to limitations with this JSON method, there isnt any way of loading more posts than what loads up. It also may load only one post some times. Viewing post comments isn't supported either. Currently it is indeed highly limited and  just for fun.
